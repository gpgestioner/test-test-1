## Configuration

- This project was started in a .Net Framework MVC 4.6.1 structure, as you have read earlier in this document, implementing that model, we also have within our architecture, we can find the services, which for now we present the logs technique and our connection to the REST api.
- The base configuration of the project is the one created by the developers based on the updates provided by the Dpella api.
- Our Web service is running on a SQL Server

##### REST service
- Remember that this project is connected to the web service to work, for that we need a class that does this serialization. So once you see that the web service is working correctly, our site will have full functionality
- Make the calls to the dpella endpoints, which work with data privacity, receiving the Dataset, Structure and Histogram lists, methods which return a *responseDTO*.

- the process to generate an Analyze in the view is as follows:
  - Enter **Datasets**
  - *Choose a column*
  - Choose the type of **Histogram** *and press continue*
  - You will see that you can perform your *analysis* by calculating the ***epsilon*** and the ***beta*** with the amount of **bins**.

##### Charts of plotly 
![Charts](https://img.shields.io/badge/plotly.com%2Fjavascript-Charts-9cf) [Plotly / Charts Javascript](https://plotly.com/javascript/error-bars/#horizontal-error-bars "Plotly / Charts Javascript")
- We use plotly as a graphics library, which is an open source library that provides what we need to make our graph. Histogram and Error Bar, etc.
